How do you Programmatically Download a Webpage in Java 10 answers
I just want to retrieve any web page's source code from Java. I found lots of solutions so far, but I couldn't find any code that works for all the links below:

The main problem for me is that some codes retrieve web page source code, but with missing ones. For example the code below does not work for the first link.

InputStream is = fURL.openStream(); //fURL can be one of the links above
BufferedReader buffer = null;
buffer = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is, "iso-8859-9"));

int byteRead;
while ((byteRead = buffer.read()) != -1) {
    builder.append((char) byteRead);
}
buffer.close();
System.out.println(builder.toString());
